A project was developed in Pyhton which will predict the price of a flat based on
the area name, the number of bathrooms, and the number of rooms. While
implementing this project I used feature engineering techniques such as scaling,
outlier handling using Standard Deviation and mean. This is based on Linear
Regression Machine Learning algorithm selected by GridSearchCV.
