Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict flat prices based on features like area name, number of bathrooms, and number of rooms. Implemented feature engineering techniques including scaling and outlier handling using standard deviation and mean. Utilized GridSearchCV to optimize the model, selecting Linear Regression for best performance. Achieved improved accuracy through refined preprocessing and model tuning.
